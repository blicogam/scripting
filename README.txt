I wanted to create a script to take a newly downloaded zip file and move
it to my Documents into an appropiately named file that exists before hand
or is created because of this move

Currently, tester.sh only takes, assuming the newest file is a zip file,
and unzips it, then moves it into the "otherDir" folder
